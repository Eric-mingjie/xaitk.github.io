## Overview
The Explanation Satisfaction Scale is intended to be used to collect judgments by research participants after they have worked with the XAI system and have been recipients of one or more explanations.

The Explanation Satisfaction Scale consists of nine, 5-point Likert items.  For each item, the user can be afforded a "free response" opportunity.

## Intended Use
The purpose of the Explanation Satisfaction Scale is to enable researchers to validate the XAI system's explanations.

## Limitations
Although scale validity has been evaluated, data on the scale reliability would be of value.
