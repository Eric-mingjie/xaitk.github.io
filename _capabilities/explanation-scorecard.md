title: Explanation Scorecard
excerpt: "The Scorecard presents a number of Levels of explanation. At the lower levels are explanations in the terms of the cues or features of individual instances. At the higher levels are explanations that answer more general questions about how the AI works. Going from the lower to higher levels can be thought of as enabling insights about the strengths and weaknesses of the AI system."

## Overview
The Scorecard presents a number of Levels of explanation. Going from the lower to higher levels can be thought of as enabling insights about the strengths and weaknesses of the AI system.

## Intended Use
System designers and developers can use the Explanation Scorecard to consider more powerful types of information to better support users in understanding how the AI works, and thereby engender appropriate trust and reliance.

## Limitations
The Scorecard should be applicable to any XAI system or explanatory methodology.
